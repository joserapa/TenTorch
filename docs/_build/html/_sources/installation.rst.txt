Installation
============

To install the package, run the following command:

::

    $ pip install tensorkrowch

You can also install directly from GitHub with:

or download the repository on your computer and run 

::

    $ pip install .

in the repository folder.

Tests are written outside the Python module, therefore they are not installed
together with the package. To test the installation, clone the repository and
run, in a Unix terminal

    $ python -m pytest -v

inside the repository folder.
