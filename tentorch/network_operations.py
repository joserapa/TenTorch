# contraction paths, einsum definition of networks, compatibility with tensornetwork

# TODO: functions to transform between tensornetwork, tntorch and tentorch
# TODO: functions to find contraction paths using tensornetwork

# TODO: implement einsum for Nodes, so that edge links are automatically
#  made and we can compute contractions between several nodes at the same time
